## About Me

I have a fascination for understanding how things work, whether it's software or hardware. C++ is my favorite language—there’s something rewarding about crafting efficient code that gets the job done.

## What I’m Into

- **Reverse Engineering**: Analyzing software to understand its inner workings and discover how it operates.
- **C++ Programming**: Building applications and solving complex problems.
- **Cybersecurity**: Exploring vulnerabilities and improving security practices.
